# Hello World 

## Hi, There!

Somewhere in the last 2 weeks, I felt that I needed a website and one on github. In fact I felt, after seeing github pages, that my long-term desire to have a web-page came closer.

It wasn't until last friday that I actually got to thinking about it seriously!

Write about theme-choose vs website in html - can be only one of it. Also theme-choose doesn't exactly work like normal jekyll. It converts all md in-place to html and expects to be discovered by links. This was pre-gem-theme behaviour ?
